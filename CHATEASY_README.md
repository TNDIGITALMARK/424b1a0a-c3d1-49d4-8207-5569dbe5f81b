- **Time Utilities**: Human-readable timestamp formatting

### State Management
- **localStorage**: Persists user display name across pages
- **React State**: Manages messages, typing indicators, and UI state
- **URL Parameters**: Routes to specific chat rooms via query params

### Real-time Simulation
- Message delivery with 100ms response time
- Typing indicators with random user simulation
- Online status updates
- Message status tracking (sent/delivered/read)
